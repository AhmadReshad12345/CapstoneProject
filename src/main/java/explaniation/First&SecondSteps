Step1:
a: Creating the simple maven project



b: Instaling plugins:
	the job of plugins are to read the file. 
	it also recognize the files types with  it`s different extention.
	1: cucumber plugin


Step2: 
a: Adding properties in POM.xml

b: Adding depedencies in POM.xml file : are use to download the JRE files of following heads
	1: cucumber
	2: selenium
	3: webdriver
	4: apache is for reading and writing a file from excelShet
	5: my sql: to connect to dataBase
	6: common.io is use for file utilites
	7: ymal: is for reading yml data files 
	8: log4j: 

c: Adding build and plugins:
	plugins are goes under the build
	build is one of the life cycle in mavan
	maven has few lifeCycle: 1- clean 2: install 3- build
	the job of build is to generate the report and execute the test cases




step 3:

	a: Creating packages and files:

packages: name convintion should be all lower case and seperate by dod.



Step4(enviroment confiration): here we work with two files with different extension, .yml and .properties
	For each file type, we will have different extension. 



A: .yml = 
	env_config.yml we need to make sure the extension is    .yml 
	yml file is key and value

note: in framework we can transmate a data in different ways:
	json
	properties
	yaml
	xml

	These files are use to store the data
	so in configration files we need to provide and dedicate that in which enviroment we want to
	run and test our test cases like which browser? which website and ...

	Why we need to use the configration filese?
	to reduce the hard coding
	we want to write the values outside of the java class

Headless: 
	in chrome we can execute headless, it means execution wll be happen but we will no see.




B: log4j.properties =
 	we need to make sure the extension is   .properties
 	design of output and location
